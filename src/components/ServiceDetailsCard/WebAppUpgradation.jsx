                        Web/App upgradation in IT services refers to the process of improving or modernizing an existing website or application to enhance performance, functionality, security, and user experience. This often involves updating the underlying technology stack, optimizing the code, redesigning the user interface (UI), and adding new features to meet evolving business needs or market trends. Upgrading can also address compatibility issues with new operating systems, browsers, or devices, ensuring that the web or mobile app continues to function smoothly across platforms. Additionally, security patches and updates are critical to protect against vulnerabilities and cyber threats. In many cases, upgradation also involves migrating the app to more scalable infrastructure, such as cloud platforms, to support growing user demands. The goal is to keep the web or app relevant, efficient, and aligned with current technological standards while delivering a seamless experience to users.
